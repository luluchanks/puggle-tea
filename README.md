# Puggle Tea

Puggle Tea is a fictional bubble tea company that stands for pugs, purity in its ingredients, and passion for its products.


This project allowed me to explore a fictional company's brand identity through marketing and visual design.  A company's website can potentially increase their profits and customers; therefore, I focused on developing a one-page website that showcases Puggle Tea as a company as well as its individual products.
